# ascii_selfies

New form of social media for uploading selfies as text files because meta is threatening to pull instagram and facebook out of europe if they can't process user data in US.

## Usage

You have to install pillow package with `python3 -m pip install pillow` for this to work.

Then just run it with `python3 img_to_ascii.py <source_img>`

The code will run the script, save the result to .txt file and print out the result 

## Updates coming
 - Maybe like automate stuff so if you upload a image to certain url it would update the readme file with the newest picture under the usage instructions, that would be neat
